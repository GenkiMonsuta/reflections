What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It gets tied to the directory of your git init. 
	This way the files in that directory will be inside the git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area contains files that are being prepared to be
	committed. The	repository contains files from the directory that 		have been committed. And the directory contains files that are tied to 		the repository and can be contained in it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	The staging area is a sort of 'waitroom' for changes to either be
	committed separately or to wait for a logical group to gather and
	than be committed together.
