When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Access from remote locations and for others to see and interact with. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So you have more control over which version gets updated and so you can play around with fragments without committing to a pull just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches.When would you use one instead of the other?
	Forks are github clones that don't appear in your local files. You can then pull a clone onto your device. Branches are than created locally. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Quick access. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Direct sharing of code. Github alternatives. 
	It would be hard to merge and collaborate in general, though if it was a tiny project or one with well defined areas of code that need little or no tampering with it would also be more direct to just share directly. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	Changes that require feedback or are simply experimental. It allows for a 'trial run' of some code without messing with the master.
