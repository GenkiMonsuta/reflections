When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Access from remote locations and for others to see and interact with. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So you have more control over which version gets updated and so you can play around with fragments without committing to a pull just yet.
